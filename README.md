## Quickstart

* Get [Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 or 2022](https://www.visualstudio.com/) (The free Community Edition suffices)
* Clone the repository (use the HTTPS URL instead of the SSH URL so you can use Visual Studio's Git integration).
* Download the [dependency binaries](https://github.com/GrognardsFromHell/Dependencies/releases/) and unzip it into project folder (where TemplePlus.sln is).
  * Use v1.10 for VS 2019, v1.11 for VS 2022
* Open TemplePlus.sln in Visual Studio
* Press F5 :)
