External Dependencies
=====================

We use CMake to pre-build our external dependencies in order to reduce the size
of a full rebuild.

To update the dependencies, launch into a Visual Studio 2019 32-bit command
prompt, and run the regenerate.cmd from this directory.

Please note that you need a rather recent version of CMake (3.20+) to build this
project.
