TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DRAGON_DISCIPLES_SPELLS_PER_DAY	TAG_DRAGON_DISCIPLE			Dragon Disciple Bonus Spells - TBD!	At each stormlord level, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or destroying undead, additional favored enemies, and so on). If the character had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a stormlord, the player must decide to which class to add each stormlord level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.

TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DRAGON_DISCIPLES_CLAWS_AND_BITE	TAG_DRAGON_DISCIPLE			Dragon Disciple Claws and Bite	At 2nd level, a dragon disciple gains claw and bite attacks if he does not already have them. Use the values below or the discipleâ€™s base claw and bite damage values, whichever are greater.A dragon disciple is considered proficient with these attacks.

At 10th level, the range of this ability increases to 60 feet.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DRAGON_DISCIPLES_WINGS	TAG_DRAGON_DISCIPLE			Dragon Disciple Wings	At 9th level, a dragon disciple grows a set of draconic wings. He may now fly at a speed equal to his normal land speed, with average maneuverability.Not implemented in ToEE as there is flight in ToEE!
