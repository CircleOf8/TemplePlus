TAG_BATTLE_HOWLER_OF_GRUUMSH	TAG_PRESTIGE_CLASSES			Battle Howler of Gruumsh	Gruumsh One Eye bestowed on his chosen people many great gifts: strength, fortitude, courage, and boundless hunger for conquest. What he didn't grant were good singing ability or sparkling wit. Despite this, the bardic tradition is alive and well in orc culture, albeit in crude form.Battle howlers of Gruumsh give mortal voice to their god's fury. At the forefront of every conflict, a battle howler's hoarse war cries incite his allies to incredible heights of fury and fortifies their courage. The most accomplished battle howlers can even channel Gruumsh's throbbing heartbeat, a sound that terrifies even the bravest opponents.Most battle howlers of Gruumsh are half-orcs. Even so, the path of the hard is a difficult one, and few orcs or half-orcs remain bards for their entire career. Most battle howlers are bard/barbarians, as their abilities complement each other nicely. A rare few also spend time as clerics, their warrior's zeal giving them a true link to the divine.Hit Die: d8Requirements:Alignment: Any chaoticSkills: Knowledge (religion) 2 ranks (omitted), ~Perform~[TAG_Perform] 8 ranksFeats: ~Cleave~[TAG_CLEAVE], ~Power Attack~[TAG_POWER_ATTACK]Deity: Must worship Gruumsh.Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BATTLE_HOWLER_OF_GRUUMSH_TABLES]Class Skills: ~Appraise~[TAG_APPRAISE], Balance, Climb, ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION], Craft, Handle Animal, ~Intimidate~[TAG_INTIMIDATE], Jump, Knowledge (all skills, taken individually), ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM], Ride, ~Search~[TAG_SEARCH], ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE], ~Spellcraft~[TAG_SPELLCRAFT], ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT], ~Survival~[TAG_SURVIVAL], and Swim.Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifierClass Features:[CMD_CHILDREN]

TAG_DRAGON_DISCIPLE	TAG_PRESTIGE_CLASSES			Dragon Disciple	The blood of dragons runs through the veins of many races. For some, this heritage manifests as a sorcerous bloodline and a predilection for magic. But a few embrace the dreams, recognizing their allure as a promise. These become dragon disciples, who use their magical power as a catalyst to ignite their dragon blood, realizing its fullest potential.Most Dragon Disciples are barbarian, fighters, or rangers who have dabbed as bards or sorcerers.

TAG_DRAGONHEART_MAGE	TAG_PRESTIGE_CLASSES			Dragonheart Mage	Some arcane spellcasters are fascinated both by the dragon's hardy physical nature as well as the dragon's spellcasting ability. The dragonheart mage is perfect for the dedicated spellcaster who wishes to embrace the power of dragon blood while still advancing in magical expertise.This prestige class is available only to those who can demonstrate draconic heritage. Most dragonheart mages are sorcerers, who ascribe their magical ability to a dragon ancestor, and this class enhances the ability to cast sorcerous magic. Multiclass sorcerer/bards might also find the Dragonheart Mage interesting, since it helps build on their already impressive Charisma-based abilities. Kobolds are drawn to the class, which offers greater physical strength as well as improved spellcasting. Mere dabblers in arcane magic are less likely to become dragonheart mages.Hit Die: d6Requirements:To qualify to become a Dragonheart Mage, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.  Spellcasting: Ability to spontaneously cast arcane spells.  Skills: Knowledge(Arcana) 8 ranks (omitted).   Languages: Draconic (omitted).   Feats: ~Draconic Heritage~[TAG_DRACONIC_HERITAGE]Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DRAGONHEART_MAGE_TABLES]Class Skills: ~Bluff~[TAG_BLUFF], ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION], ~Gather Information~[TAG_GATHER_INFORMATION], Knowledge (all, taken individually), ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], Speak Language, ~Search~[TAG_SEARCH], ~Spellcraft~[TAG_SPELLCRAFT], ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT].Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifierClass Features:[CMD_CHILDREN]

You can use a standard action to change arcane spell energy into a breath weapon that deals 2d6 points of damage per level of the spell that you expend.As you gain levels in this prestige class, however, the amount of damage you can deal increases.

TAG_FIST_OF_THE_FOREST	TAG_PRESTIGE_CLASSES			Fist of the Forest	For some among the Guardians of the Green, the pursuit of an animalistic lifestyle is a form of asceticism. A feral disposition seems to come naturally to others. In either case, the result is a powerful defender of nature: the Fist of the Forest.Becoming a Fist of the Forest: Though the two classes seem to have little in common, the paths of the monk and the barbarian often converge in the fist of the forest. Monks and other disciplined characters seek heightened connections with nature through a primal devotion to its defense. Barbarians and other wild characters seem to simply end up on this path if they are fated for it.Combat: Your most powerful attacks are your unarmed strikes, so you should charge into the thick of battle as quickly as possible.

TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_FIST_OF_THE_FOREST_FERAL_TRANCE	TAG_FIST_OF_THE_FOREST			Feral Trance	Once per day, you can enter a feral battle trance. While you are in this state, the raw power of the beast flows through you. Your hands and feet become clawlike (destroying any shoes or gloves you are wearing), and your teeth lengthen and grow pointed. For the duration of the trance, you gain a +4 bonus to ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] and a +2 bonus on damage rolls with your unarmed strikes.You can also make one bite attack per round at your highest attack bonus whenever you attack as a ~full-round action~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION].The damage for this attack is 1d6 + your Str modifier, regardless of your size. A feral trance lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your Con modifier. While in a trance, you cannot perform certain actions, and afterward you are fatigued. These restrictions are the same as those for the ~barbarian's rage class feature~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARBARIAN_RAGE]. If you have the ability to enter a rage, you can do so while in a feral trance, using your increased Constitution score to determine the duration of both effects.At 3rd level, you can use this ability twice per day.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_FIST_OF_THE_FOREST_PRIMAL_LIVING	TAG_FIST_OF_THE_FOREST			Primal Living	To maintain your bestial powers, you must live like a wild animal. You must sleep in natural environments, never inside buildings, unless forced by circumstances . Furthermore, you cannot purchase food - you must obtain it by hunting, gathering, begging, or stealing. Some Fists of the Forest even give up speech, the use of fire and tools, and all possessions, but such extremes are not required.In any month in which you buy food or voluntarily sleep indoors more than three times, all your Fist of the Forest class features cease to function until you have spent thirty consecutive days living like an animal once more, or until a fellow Guardian of the Green casts atonement on you.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_FIST_OF_THE_FOREST_UNARMED_DAMAGE	TAG_FIST_OF_THE_FOREST			Unarmed Damage	Your unarmed attacks deal more damage than usual. At 1st level, you deal 1d8 points of damage with each unarmed strike. When you attain 3rd level, this damage increases to 1d10 points. See the ~monk class feature~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_UNARMED_STRIKE].If your unarmed attack already deals this amount of damage, increase the base damage to the next step indicated on the monk class table.

See the ~barbarian class feature~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARBARIAN_UNCANNY_DODGE]. If you already have uncanny dodge from another class, you instead gain ~improved uncanny dodge~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_IMPROVED_UNCANNY_DODGE].Note: At the moment Improved Uncanny Dodge is not granted if the character already has Uncanny Dodge
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_FIST_OF_THE_FOREST_UNTAMED_STRIKE	TAG_FIST_OF_THE_FOREST			Untamed Strike	On attaining 2nd level, you can channel the untamed power of nature when you attack. Your unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons; see the ~monk's ki strike class feature~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_KI_STRIKE].If your unarmed strikes are already magical, they instead are treated lesser ghost touch weapons. They deal full damage against incorporeal creatures 50% of the time and half damage the rest of the time.Note: The Ghost Touch part is not implemented yet.
TAG_MARSHALS	TAG_NONCORE_CLASSES			Marshals	Sometimes it is not enough to be a conquering warrior, a champion of all that's right, an experienced sellsword, or an elite foot soldier. Sometimes the circumstances require a solid commander of soldiers and situations. Sometimes the circumstances demand a marshal.Characteristics: Trained in the basics of fighting, marshals possess a general knowledge of weapons and armor. Their real strength is their ability to lead those who follow them to success they might not otherwise reach in combat. Marshals make passable warriors themselves, when personal danger finds them.Religion: Marshals often worship Heironeous (god of valor) or Kord (god of strength). Some worship St. Cuthbert (god of retribution), Hextor (god of tyranny), or Erythnul (god of slaughter).Other Classes: The marshal relies on the other classes in all ways -- it is his job to support a team, magnifying the strengths of each member for success in battles or forays into dangerous cavern complexes.Role: In most adventuring parties, the marshal serves as the lead tactician, while his comrades support him with spells, ranged attacks, and other effects. However, once a plan is in motion, most marshals enter the melee to assure victory.Alignment: Marshals may be of any alignment. Good-aligned marshals are often crusading leaders who seek out and fight evil. Lawful-aligned marshals accept commissions from people who face invasion by foreign aggressors. Chaotic-aligned marshals lead mercenaries to wherever the pay is best. Evil-aligned marshals tend to lead forces of foreign aggressors set on invasion and plunder.Hit Die: d8Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MARSHAL]Class Skills: ~Bluff~[TAG_BLUFF], ~Diplomacy~[TAG_DIPLOMACY], Handle Animal, ~Intimidate~[TAG_INTIMIDATE], Knowledge, ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM], Ride, ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE], Speak Language, ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT], ~Survival~[TAG_SURVIVAL], and ~Swim~[TAG_SWIM].Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifierClass Features:[CMD_CHILDREN]

TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MARSHAL_AURAS	TAG_MARSHALS			Marshal Auras	The marshal exerts an effect on allies in his vicinity. He can learn to produce different effects, or auras, over the course of his career. The marshal may project one minor aura and (starting at 2nd level) one major aura at a time.Projecting an aura is a swift action. The aura remains in effect until the marshal uses a free action to dismiss it or activates another aura of the same kind (major or minor). A marshal can have an aura active continually; thus, an aura can be in effect at the start of a combat encounter even before the marshal takes his first turn.Activating an aura involves haranguing, ordering, directing, encouraging, cajoling, or calming allies. A marshal sizes up the enemy, allies, and the terrain, then gives allies the direction that they can use to do their best.Unless otherwise noted, a marshal's aura affects all allies within 60 feet (including himself) who can hear the marshal. An ally must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher and be able to understand the marshal's language to gain the bonus. A marshal's aura is dismissed if he is dazed, unconscious, stunned, paralyzed, or otherwise unable to be heard or understood by his allies.A marshal begins play knowing one minor aura of his choice. As his marshal level increases, he gains access to new auras, as indicated on Table 1-5: The Marshal.All bonuses granted by a marshal's auras are circumstance bonuses that do not stack with each other.Minor Auras:A minor aura lets allies add the marshal's Charisma bonus (if any) to certain rolls.~Minor Aura List~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MARSHAL_MINOR_AURAS][CMD_CHILDREN_SORTED]Major Auras:Beginning at 2nd level, a marshal can project a major aura in addition to his minor aura. A major aura lets allies add +1 to certain rolls. This bonus improves by +1 at 7th, 14th, and 20th level.~Major Aura List~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MARSHAL_MAJOR_AURAS][CMD_CHILDREN_SORTED]

TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MARSHAL_SKILL_FOCUS	TAG_MARSHALS			Skill Focus(Diplomacy)	Because a marshal has a way with people, he gains this feat as a bonus feat. If the marshal already has the feat, he can choose a different one.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MARSHAL_ADRENALINE_BOOST	TAG_MARSHALS			Adrenaline Boost	Starting at 4th level, you can exhort your allies to discover a reservoir of energy they didn't think they had. Once per day, as a standard action, you can grant temporary hit points equal to your marshal level to any or all of your allies within 30 feet (but not to yourself). If the ally's current hit point total is no more than half his full normal hit points, the number of temporary hit points granted to that character is doubled (to twice your marshal level).This ability only affects allies with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher who can hear you and understand your language. The temporary hit points last for up to 1 minute per marshal level.At 8th level, you can use this ability twice per day. You can use it three times per day at 12th level, four times per day at 16th level, and five times per day at 20th level.If you use this ability on a creature that is still under the effect of a previous use, the new temporary hit points overlap (do not stack with) the temporary hit points the creature had remaining.

TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_STORMLORD_THUNDERING_WEAPONS	TAG_STORMLORDS			Stormlords Thundering Weapons	For a stormlord of 5th level or higher, any spear or javelin he uses is treated as a thundering weapon.
