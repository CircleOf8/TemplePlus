The casting time is a ~swift action~[TAG_FREE_ACTION] rather than a standard action. Each round, if there are fewer than the maximum number of images, an additional image appears. However, if all images are destroyed, the spell still ends entirely.Note: when empowered, this spell's maximum is treated as a cap on the bonus to the roll. So, at maximum level, the 5-8 variable is being empowered to 7-12. The maximum for the per-round images is increased as well, e.g. to 12 for one use of empower.
