TAG_WARLOCKS	TAG_NONCORE_CLASSES			Warlocks	Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_STORMLORD_TABLES]Class Skills: TBD Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifierClass Features:[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_WARLOCK_WEAPON_ARMOR_PROF	TAG_WARLOCKS			Weapon and Armor Proficiency	Warlocks are proficient with all simple weapons. They are proficient with light armor but not with shields.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_WARLOCK_ELDRITCH_BLAST	TAG_WARLOCKS			Eldritch Blast	The first ability a warlock learns is eldritch blast. A warlock attacks his foes with eldritch power, using baleful magical energy to deal damage and sometimes impart other debilitating effects.An eldritch blast is a ray with a range of 60 feet. It is a ranged touch attack that affects a single target, allowing no saving throw. An eldritch blast deals 1d6 points of damage at 1st level and increases in power as the warlock rises in level. An eldritch blast has a spell level equal to half of the warlock level (min 1, max 9 at 18th level). If you apply a blast shape or eldritch essence invocation to your eldritch blast, your eldritch blast uses the highest applicable spell level.An eldritch blast is subject to spell resistance, although the Spell Penetration feat and other effects that improve caster level checks to overcome spell resistance also apply to eldritch blast. An eldritch blast deals half damage to objects. Metamagic feats cannot improve a warlock's eldritch blast (because it is a spell-like ability, not a spell). However, the feat Ability Focus (eldritch blast) increases the DC for all saving throws (if any) associated with a warlock's eldritch blast by 2.A warlock can use eldritch blast at will.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_WARLOCK_INVOCATIONS	TAG_WARLOCKS			Invocations	A warlock does not prepare or cast spells as other wielders of arcane magic do. Instead, he possesses a repertoire of attacks, defenses, and abilities known as invocations that require him to focus the wild energy that suffuses his soul. A warlock can use any invocation he knows at will, with the following qualifications:A warlock's invocations are spell-like abilities; using an invocation is therefore a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. An invocation can be disrupted, just as a spell can be ruined during casting. A warlock is entitled to a Concentration check to successfully use an invocation if he is hit by an attack while invoking, just as a spellcaster would be. A warlock can choose to use an invocation defensively, by making a successful Concentration check, to avoid provoking attacks of opportunity. A warlock's invocations are subject to spell resistance unless an invocation's description specifically states otherwise. A warlock's caster level with his invocations is equal to his warlock level.The save DC for an invocation (if it allows a save) is 10 + equivalent spell level + the warlock's Charisma modifier. Since spell-like abilities are not actually spells, a warlock cannot benefit from the Spell Focus feat. He can, however, benefit from the Ability Focus feat, as well as from feats that emulate metamagic effects for spell-like abilities, such as Quicken Spell-Like Ability and Empower Spell-Like Ability.The four grades of invocations, in order of their relative power, are least, lesser, greater, and dark. A warlock begins with knowledge of one invocation, which must be of the lowest grade (least). As a warlock gains levels, he learns new invocations, as summarized on Table: The Warlock and described below. A list of available invocations can be found on the warlock invocations page.At any level when a warlock learns a new invocation, he can also replace an invocation he already knows with another invocation of the same or a lower grade. At 6th level, a warlock can replace a least invocation he knows with a different least invocation (in addition to learning a new invocation, which could be either least or lesser). At 11th level, a warlock can replace a least or lesser invocation he knows with another invocation of the same or a lower grade (in addition to learning a new invocation, which could be least, lesser, or greater). At 16th level, a warlock can replace a least, lesser, or greater invocation he knows with another invocation of the same or a lower grade (in addition to learning a new invocation, which could be least, lesser, greater, or dark).Finally, unlike other spell-like abilities, invocations are subject to arcane spell failure chance as described under Weapon and Armor Proficiency above. Warlocks can qualify for some prestige classes usually intended for spellcasters; see below.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_WARLOCK_DETECT_MAGIC	TAG_WARLOCKS			Detect Magic	Beginning at 2nd level, a warlock can use detect magic as the spell at will. His caster level equals his class level.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_WARLOCK_DAMAGE_REDUCTION	TAG_WARLOCKS			Damage Reduction	Fortified by the supernatural power flowing in his body, a warlock becomes resistant to physical attacks at 3rd level and above, gaining damage reduction 1/cold iron. At 7th level and every four levels thereafter, a warlock's damage reduction improves by 1 to a max DR5/Cold Iron at level 19.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_WARLOCK_FIENDISH_RESILIENCE	TAG_WARLOCKS			Fiendish Resilience	Beginning at 8th level, a warlock knows the trick of fiendish resilience. Once per day, as a free action, he can enter a state that lasts for 2 minutes. While in this state, the warlock gains fast healing 1.At 13th level, a warlock's fiendish resilience improves. When in his fiendish resilience state, he gains fast healing 2 instead. At 18th level, a warlock's fiendish resilience improves to fast healing 5.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_WARLOCK_ENERGY_RESISTANCE	TAG_WARLOCKS			Energy Resistance	At 10th level and higher, a warlock has resistance 5 against any two of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic. Once the types are chosen, this energy resistance cannot be changed. At 20th level, a warlock gains resistance 10 against the two selected types of energy.
